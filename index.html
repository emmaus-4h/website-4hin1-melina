      Johnny is a karate student at the Cobra Kai karate dojo, a dojo notorious for its extreme teaching methods where students learn, among other things, never to show mercy to an enemy. When Daniel is attacked by Johnny and his friends one night, Mr. Miyagi intervenes. Shooting for the film was made in the People's Republic of China, among other places. Shooting started in June 2009 and was completed in October 2009. Unlike the original film, this film is not about the modern interpretation of karate. The Karate Kid is a semi-autobiographical story based on the life of its screenwriter, Robert Mark Kamen. At age 17, after the 1964 New York World's Fair, Kamen was beaten up by a gang of bullies. He thus began to study martial arts in order to defend himself.

        The Karate Kid follows Daniel LaRusso (Macchio), a teenager taught karate by Mr. Miyagi (Morita) to help defend himself and compete in a tournament against his bullies, one of whom is Johnny Lawrence (Zabka), the ex-boyfriend of his love interest Ali Mills (Shue). Decide what it is you want from life and work how best you can to achieve it with 100% commitment you'll fulfill your goals. “It's ok to lose to opponent. It's never ok to lose to fear”. In Karate Kid 2 Daniel La Russo goes with Mr. Miyagi (his teacher) to the teacher's childhood home. More information about Miyagi's past comes to light, as well as confronting his former nemesis. Mr. Miyagi taught Daniel that nature itself had imposed the rule, “First learn stand, then learn fly.” He said this to teach the young, impulsive Daniel to have patience with his progress. Mastery takes time and discipline: the fundamentals must become second nature before you can attain more complex techniques. The lesson is to stand up for yourself and what you believe, be mindful of others and you can overcome anything.
