        <p>"The Karate Kid" was one of the nice surprises of 1984 -- an exciting, sweet-tempered, heart-warming story with one of the most interesting friendships in a long time. The friends come from different worlds. A kid named Daniel (Ralph Macchio) is a New Jersey teenager who moves with his mother to Los Angeles. An old guy named Miyagi (Pat Morita) is the Japanese janitor in their apartment building. When Daniel starts to date the former girlfriend of the toughest kid in the senior class, the kid starts pounding on Daniel's head on a regular basis. Daniel tries to fight back, but this is a Southern California kid, and so of course he has a black belt in karate. Enter Mr. Miyagi, who seems to be a harmless old eccentric with a curious hobby: He tries to catch flies with chopsticks. It turns out that Miyagi is a karate master, a student not only of karate fighting but of the total philosophy of the martial arts. He agrees to take Daniel as his student.</p>

     <p> Resting on his laurels as an undisputed Karate Champion, Daniel LaRusso and his invaluable dear mentor, Mr Miyagi, return to the latter's hometown in humid Okinawa, after receiving an urgent letter about the sensei's gravely ill father. It's been already many years since the karate master left Japan; however, the need to tie up some loose ends of the past is as imperative as ever, as Miyagi's childhood friend and now an embittered sworn enemy, is still waiting for an opportunity to a lethal fight to the death. Obviously, almost half a lifetime isn't enough to leave the past behind--and to make matters worse--Sato's nephew, Chozen, thirsts to continue the feud by challenging Miyagi's love-smitten apprentice, Daniel, to a no-holds-barred match. But isn't love worth fighting for?  </p>

      Silver and Kreese want revenge on Daniel and Miyagi for them losing their karate school. Meanwhile, Miyagi has lost his job at the apartment building. His dream is to open a store selling bonsai trees, and Daniel wants to fund it for him. He uses his college money to buy premises for his friend. Then Daniel meets Jessica and they strike up a friendship. The All-Valley Karate Tournament is coming up, and Silver's friends, Mike and Snake, threaten Daniel to make him enter. Daniel says he won't enter. Further threats follow, and Miyage's bonsai collection is stolen. When Daniel and Jessica try to retrieve a bonsai on a cliff face, Silver's buddies come along and take away the climbing ropes, leaving Daniel stranded at the bottom, with no choice but to agree to enter the tournament. Miyagi tells Daniel he will not train him for the competition. Silver (Daniel doesn't know who he is) offers to train Daniel. His training is very different from Miyagi's. After attacking a man at a club, Daniel's new aggression comes out.
